# 📋 Introduction
## 📎 Docker
Docker is a set of platform as a service products that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers.

## 📎 Container
Container is a lightweight and standalone executable software package that includes everything needed to run a piece of software, including the code, runtime, system tools, system libraries, and settings. It encapsulates the software in a complete filesystem that contains everything it needs to run, ensuring consistency and reliability across different computing environments.
